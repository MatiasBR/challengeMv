# Full Stack Developer Challenge - Next.js & LangChain.js

## Project Description

This project is a full-stack application built with **Next.js** and **LangChain.js**. It allows users to submit queries and receive responses generated by a LangChain.js agent that uses a web search tool and a local language model (LLM) powered by **Ollama**.

The system consists of:
1. A form page in Next.js where users can input their queries.
2. A Next.js API route that triggers a LangChain.js agent.
3. A results page where users can view the generated response.

## System Requirements

- **Frontend**: A Next.js page with a form for submitting queries.
- **Backend**: A Next.js API route that:
  - Uses a web search tool from LangChain.js.
  - Executes a local language model (LLM) via Ollama.
  - Returns a response based on the user's query.
- **Results**: A Next.js page that displays the generated response.

## How to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/challenge.git
   cd challenge
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:
   ```env
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
   ```
   API key is required to use the Tavily APIs. All Tavily endpoints require authentication via API keys. You can obtain a free API key by registering on their website.

4. **Run Ollama**:
   Ensure Ollama is installed and running a local model. For example:
   ```bash
   ollama run mistral
   ```

5. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
